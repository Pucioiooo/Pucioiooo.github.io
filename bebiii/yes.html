        <h1>I'm Sorry</h1>
        <p>I know I hurt you, and I deeply regret my actions especially on before your birthday. That day was supposed to be about you, about making you feel special, but instead, I let my emotions get in the way and ruined it. You deserved so much better from me.</p>
        <p>I've taken time to reflect, and I now see how my actions made you feel unimportant and unloved. That was never my intention, but I understand that intentions mean nothing without action. Here are the promises I want to make to you:</p>

        <ul class="promises">
            <li>I will make you feel special and valued, not just on big occasions but every single day.</li>
            <li>I will show my love through actions, not just words, so that you never have to doubt how much you mean to me.</li>
            <li>I will always fight for our relationship, making sure you know I would never let you go easily.</li>
            <li>I will be there for you, consistently and wholeheartedly, no matter what we go through.</li>
            <li>I will show up for you on important days, and make the necessary compromises to ensure we're both happy and handle my emotions better. </li>
            <li>I will work on myself to be a better partner the one who makes you feel secure, loved, and cherished.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You are incredibly important to me, and I never want to make you feel otherwise again. I donâ€™t just want to say these words, I want to prove them through time, patience, and effort.</p>

        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>Moving forward, I promise to:</p>
        <ul class="terms">
            <li>Show through my actions that I love and appreciate you.</li>
            <li>Make an effort every day to strengthen our relationship.</li>
            <li>Listen to you, understand you, and always make you feel heard.</li>
            <li>Handle conflicts with patience and love instead of shutting down.</li>
            <li>Give you the consistency and care that you deserve.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I love you, and I want to be the man you deserve.</p>
