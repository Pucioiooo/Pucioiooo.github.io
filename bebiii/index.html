 <h1 class="display-4">Dear Charisse, the love of my life ❤️</h1>
        <p class="lead mt-4">I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about everything, and I realize now just how much I hurt you especially on before your 24th birthday. 
            That was supposed to be a special day for you, and instead of making you feel celebrated, I let my emotions get in the way and ruined it by not paying attention to what you wanted and needed. 
            You deserved a day filled with love, warmth, and happiness, and I failed to give that to you. I am truly sorry. 
            Beyond that, I’ve made you feel unimportant in ways I never intended. 
            The way I’ve acted made you doubt how much I love you, and that’s the last thing I ever wanted. 
            Love isn’t just words but also showing up, making you feel special every day, and never making you question how much you mean to me. 
            I should have done more, and I will do more. When you said you wanted to break up, I should have fought harder and not hurt you even more and hurt everyone around me. 
            Not because I wanted to pressure you, but because you deserved to see how much I value our relationship. 
            I should have shown you, not just told you that I care deeply and that I never want to lose you. 
            My silence and hesitation made it seem like I was willing to let you go, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. 
            I don’t expect this message to fix everything overnight. I know words alone aren’t enough. But I want you to know that I see where I went wrong, and I’m not going to let this be just another apology. 
            I want to prove through time, patience, and effort that my love for you is real, and that making you feel special and important is my priority. 
            No matter where we stand, I want you to be happy. But if there's even a small chance that I can make you feel cherished again, I won’t take it for granted.</p>
